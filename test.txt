==================== OSNOVI NA HTML I CSS ================

HTML:

HTML е кратенка за Hypertext Markup Language. Тоа е стандарден јазик за 
означување што се користи за креирање веб-страници и други видови онлајн 
содржини што може да се прикажат на интернет. HTML им овозможува на 
програмерите да ја структурираат содржината на веб-страница со дефинирање 
на наслови, параграфи, списоци, врски, слики и други елементи. Исто така, 
овозможува користење на листови со стилови и јазици за скриптирање како 
CSS и JavaScript за контрола на изгледот и однесувањето на веб-страниците.

HTML е составен од серија ознаки затворени во аголни загради. Ознаките ја 
дефинираат структурата и содржината на веб-страницата и може да вклучуваат 
атрибути кои специфицираат дополнителни информации за некој елемент. На 
пример, ознаката <img> се користи за вградување слика на веб-страница, а 
атрибутот src ја одредува URL-то или патеката на датотеката на сликата што 
треба да се прикаже.

<meta> tag can be used to specify various types of metadata, such as the 
page's title, author, description, keywords, character encoding, and more.

including text, images, links, videos, and other media.

link to another web page, a file, or a location on the same page. The "a" 
stands for "anchor", and it is also known as the anchor tag.

- <ol></ol> - The <ol> tag is used to create an ordered list, which is a 
list of items where each item is numbered or ordered in some way.

- <ul></ul> - The <ul> tag, on the other hand, is used to create an 
unordered list, which is a list of items where each item is not ordered or 
numbered in any particular way. 

- <li></li> - The <li> tag is an HTML element used to represent a single 
item in a list. It stands for "list item" and is used within <ol> (ordered

page.

- <nav></nav> - The <nav> tag is an HTML element used to define a section 
of a web page that contains navigation links to other pages or sections of

<footer> tags, or within the <body> tag to define a specific navigation 
section within the content of the web page.

Examples and explanations:

-------- <input type="email" name="e-mail" id="e-mail" /> --------

This line of code creates an <input> element with three attributes: type, name, and id.

The TYPE attribute is set to "email", which indicates that this input is intended for entering an email address. This can provide some validation checks on the entered email address to ensure that it is in a valid format.

The NAME attribute is set to "e-mail", which is the name of the input control that will be sent to the server when the form is submitted. The server can then use this name to identify the email address that was entered.

The ID attribute is set to "e-mail", which provides a unique identifier for the input element. This can be used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the input control.

Overall, this line of code creates an email input control with the name "e-mail" and the ID "e-mail", which can be used for validation and identification purposes.



HTML TAGS

- <form></form> - The <form> tag is an HTML element used to create a container for interactive input elements, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, and more. It is used to collect user input and send it to a server for further processing.

The <form> tag has two main attributes: action and method.

The ACTION attribute specifies where the form data should be sent for processing. This is 
typically a URL that points to a server-side script that will process the form data.

The METHOD attribute specifies how the form data should be sent to the server. There are two possible values for this attribute: GET and POST. When using GET, the form data is appended to the URL as a query string, while with POST, the form data is sent in the request body.

- <input /> - The <input> element is a fundamental form element in HTML used to create a variety of form controls. It is a self-closing tag and can include several attributes that define the behavior of the input control, such as type, name, value, placeholder, and more.

The most common input types are:

text: used to create a single-line text input field
password: used to create a single-line password input field
email: used to create a single-line email input field
checkbox: used to create a checkbox control
radio: used to create a radio button control
submit: used to create a submit button control

- <label></label> - The <label> tag is another fundamental form element in HTML that is used to associate a label with an input control. The label is used to describe the purpose of the input control, and is typically displayed alongside the control.

-<button></button> - The <button> tag is used to create a clickable button on a web page. The button can perform different actions when clicked, such as submitting a form or triggering some JavaScript function. The <button> tag can contain text or other HTML elements, such as images or icons, to provide additional context or visual cues to the user.

- <textarea></textarea> The <textarea> tag in HTML is used to create a multi-line input field where users can enter text. Unlike the <input> tag which is used for single-line inputs, the <textarea> tag can accept multiple lines of text.

- <select></select> - The <select> tag in HTML is used to create a drop-down list of options that users can choose from. It is often used in HTML forms to allow users to select one or more options from a list.

- <option> - The <option> tag is used to define the options that appear in a drop-down list created with the <select> tag. Each option is defined with an <option> tag, and the content of the tag is the text that appears in the list for that option.

- <optgroup></optgroup> - The <optgroup> tag is used to group related options in a drop-down list created with the <select> tag. It is a child element of the <select> tag and can contain one or more <option> tags. 

-<fieldset></fieldset> - The <fieldset> tag is an HTML container element that is used to group related form elements together. It can be used to visually separate the form fields into logical sections or categories.

- <div></div> - The div tag is used to create a block-level container element that groups other HTML elements together. It is used to divide sections of a webpage into distinct and meaningful parts, such as header, navigation, content, and footer. The div tag has a default display property of block, which means it starts on a new line and takes up the entire width available. The div tag is often used with CSS styling to apply a common style to multiple elements within the container.

- <span></span> - The span tag is used to create an inline-level container element that is used to group inline-level elements together. It is often used to apply styles to a small portion of text, such as a single word or phrase within a paragraph. The span tag has a default display property of inline, which means it does not start on a new line and only takes up the width of its contents.
